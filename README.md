## What Is It For?

- The [Steiner system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_system) $S(5, 8, 24)$
- The [extended binary Golay code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Golay_code) and the [perfect binary Golay code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_Golay_code)  
- The [Mathieu group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathieu_group) $M_{24}$ and its subgroups  
- Other related mathematical structures
